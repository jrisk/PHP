<h1>Hi World</h1>
<div class='welcome'>Welcome to the website of the 21st century</div>

<div class='site'>
<p><b>This is a website test for CSS. Currently I am on page 462 of the HTML,
CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Javascript Book. Plans are to go on to Head First Javascript and then after that to
either Java or Python, with an emphasis more on Javascript and Web site development and design. Although I 
will hope to continue applying python in the form of django web frameworks and using wordpress to practice HTML
and CSS themes. I hope to be, by the beginning of spring, on my way to having a good hold on what I want to 
do in the field of programming and computer science with an emphasis on web development as of right now. This is
so that when I go on to get another degree or certifications I won't have to flail around and worry about which
direction I should go while I'm there, and instead already be on course and know what I want to do and act 
swiftly and with authority, to make up for lost time and ensure a bright future for myself and loved ones who 
expect things out of me and whom I want to make proud.</b></p>
<b>HOPE YOU ENJOY THE SITE. I KNOW I WILL!</b>
